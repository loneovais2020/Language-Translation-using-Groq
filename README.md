AI-Powered Language Translation Application
This project demonstrates a simple yet powerful language translation application using state-of-the-art AI technologies. It leverages Groq's large language models, LangChain for prompt engineering, LangServe for API deployment, and Streamlit for the user interface.
Features

Real-time translation to multiple languages
User-friendly interface for input and language selection
Scalable backend using FastAPI
Efficient API calls using LangServe

Technologies Used

Groq: Provides the large language model for translations
LangChain: Used for prompt engineering and chain composition
LangServe: Facilitates easy API deployment
Streamlit: Powers the user interface
FastAPI: Provides the backend framework
